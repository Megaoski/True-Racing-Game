# True-Racing-Game

This is a project for Physics class made by Oscar Larios and Vladislav Bulantsev.
It was developed using BulletPhysics.

It's a racing game that consists of a circuit and a timer. The goal
of the game is to finish one lap in the fastest time possible whithin 3 lives.

At first sight it seems quite easy but don't be too cocky as the car
is not that easy to manipulate.

Controls:

UP - ACCELERATE
DOWN - BREAK/REVERSE
LEFT - TURN LEFT
RIGHT - TURN RIGHT
R - RESTART FROM THE BEGINNING

Enjoy!


PS:

We had to create another github repository cause on the first one we had
some trouble on doing a commit and we could not even discard changes or anything else.
